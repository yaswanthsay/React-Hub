            <h4>So we are going to start our journey together.Let us start by describing slightly about React.Everyone may not be aware of the facts about React that we should know.</h4>
            <h5>So first question is whether React is a library or a framework.</h5>
            <p>React is a library not a framework</p>
            <h5>Then what are the most basic and important properties of React</h5>
            <p>And the most important feature of react is that usage of virtual Dom along with Real DOM.The data flow of React is not bidirectional .It is unidirectional, that is from parent to child</p>
